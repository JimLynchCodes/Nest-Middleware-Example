# Nest-Middleware-Example


The `master` branch is a fresh NestJS project scaffold using these commands:
```
nest new project-name
```

The `with-middleware` branch has a new middleware added, generated with the command
```
nest mi cool-middleware
```

_Note: to install the NestJS cli:_
```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```
